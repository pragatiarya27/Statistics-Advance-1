# Statistics-Advance-1
In this, we explored key concepts of probability and statistics, including random variables, their types, and the differences between discrete and continuous distributions. We studied important probability models such as the binomial distribution and the standard normal distribution. We also examined the Central Limit Theorem and the role of confidence intervals in statistical estimation. Using Python, we generated random data, calculated mean and standard deviation, plotted a histogram, and computed a confidence interval for real sales data. Overall, the assignment combined theoretical understanding with practical data analysis to demonstrate how statistical methods are applied in real-world situations.
